- Drill files

---

### 2️⃣ CAM Processing
Gerber files were imported into FlatCAM to generate machining toolpaths.

Operations performed:
- Copper isolation routing
- Drilling path generation
- Board outline cutting

---

### 3️⃣ G-Code Generation
Toolpaths were converted into CNC compatible G-code.

---

### 4️⃣ CNC Machining
Generated G-code was executed on a CNC router to manufacture the PCB.
